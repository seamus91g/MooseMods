		<span style="color:red">3.</span><b> What happens when i mod my console and why should i do it?
		</b><br/>
		<span style="color:red">ANS.</span> Modding a console changes the way in which the console reads games and allows the console to read games that you yourself burn from a disc. This allows you to create backups of your games that you want to keep safe. There is absolutley no downside to modding your console. It gives your console the ability to read backup discs, but it will still read retail games just as it has always done. It is perfectly legal to mod your console and create backups of your own games, but it is not legal to make a copy of a game that you do not own.
